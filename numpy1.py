#NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
#NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
import numpy  
arr = numpy.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)

# NumPy is usually imported under the np alias.
#Create an alias with the as keyword while importing:
import numpy as np
arr=np.array([1,2,3,4,5])   #output [1 2 3 4 5]
print(arr)
